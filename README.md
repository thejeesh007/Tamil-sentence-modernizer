# 📝 Tamil Classical Text Modernizer

The **Tamil Classical Text Modernizer** is an intelligent linguistic tool that automatically translates **classical or literary Tamil** into **modern, easily understandable Tamil**. This project is designed to bridge the language gap for readers, students, and researchers who find ancient Tamil texts difficult to comprehend.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Classical Tamil literature, though rich in heritage and depth, can be hard to interpret for modern readers due to archaic vocabulary, grammar, and poetic constructs. This tool simplifies such texts using a hybrid **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline—making Tamil literature more accessible and inclusive.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Converts classical/literary Tamil to modern Tamil  
- 🧠 Uses hybrid NLP techniques for intelligent interpretation  
- 🗂️ Handles complex grammar and sentence structures  
- 🪶 Useful for students, language learners, and researchers  
- 🌐 Optional web interface using Streamlit  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **NLP Libraries:** spaCy, Indic NLP, NLTK (based on implementation)  
- **Translation Model:** Custom-trained or fine-tuned transformer (e.g., BERT, mBART)  
- **Streamlit** (optional – for frontend interface)  
- **Git/GitHub** – version control
