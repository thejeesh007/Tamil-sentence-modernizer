The Tamil Classical Text Modernizer is an intelligent linguistic tool designed to convert classical or literary Tamil passages into modern, easily understandable Tamil using a hybrid Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. It eliminates the need for users to manually interpret archaic or complex Tamil texts by providing simplified, modern equivalents.
